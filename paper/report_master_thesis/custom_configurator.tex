Developers and researchers can use \toolname{} to edit or create schemas and to edit data based on a given schema, in an assisted manner.
We intend for \toolname{} to also be a tool, which can be used to create a \textit{configurator} for any particular use case.
This use-case specific configurator can then be shared with anyone, by sharing a web URL with them.
When a user accesses the URL, \toolname{} is opened, with a pre-defined \textit{schema}, \textit{data file} and \textit{settings} loaded.
For example, a team of researchers might define a schema for experimental data. 
They could then generate a URL which will open \toolname{} with the experiment schema, an initial data file of their choice and settings of their choice.
This URL can then be shared with others researchers, who can use the tool to fill in their experimental data into the form (the GUI editor panel).
Simultaneously, the text editor panel would show and teach the researchers how the actual JSON or YAML data looks like, when adhering to the schema.
Apart from the field of research, this approach can be applied for any kind of structured data and a corresponding domain-specific \textit{configurator} URL generated.

\subsubsection{Basic support for pre-defined data}\label{subsubsec:custom_configurator_basic}
We implement support for loading pre-defined data based on the \textit{query string} in the URL.
Therefore, we introduce the following optional query string parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{data:} URL to the data file to load
	\item \textbf{schema:} URL to the schema file to load
	\item \textbf{settings:} URL to the settings file to load
\end{itemize}

Additionally, we introduce a new settings property \textit{toolbarTitle}, which defines the title that is displayed on the \toolname{} toolbar on top of the page.

Figure \ref{fig:custom_configurator} shows the resulting view of \toolname{}, when opening it using the exemplary URL \underline{logende.org/meta-configurator/?data=a\&schema=b\&settings=c}, with \textit{a}, \textit{b}, \textit{c} being URLs to a data, a schema and a settings file.
Note that \toolname{} is opened in the \textit{file editor} mode, with a pre-defined \textit{Self-Driving Vehicle} schema, a pre-defined data file and a custom tile ("Autonomous Vehicle Editor"), which is set in the pre-defined settings file.

\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Advanced support for exporting custom configurators}

With the features described in section \ref{subsubsec:custom_configurator_basic} it is possible for anyone to hand-craft a \toolname{} URL that will load pre-defined data, if the corresponding files are already stored and accessible somewhere.
It has the following limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The user has to store the raw files somewhere, in an accessible manner
	\item The user has to handcraft the \toolname{} URL with the query string
	\item The resulting URL is very long
\end{enumerate}

However, the implemented functionality can be complemented by a button in the \toolname{} UI, which will perform the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Store user files in backend
	\item Generate URL that refers to the files in the backend
	\item Shorten the URL and store it in the backend too
	\item Return the shortened URL to the user
\end{enumerate}
