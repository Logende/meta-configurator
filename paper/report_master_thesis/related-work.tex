This section covers existing schema languages and existing approaches to generate UIs from them.
% We compare the schema languages briefly and discuss why JSON schema is the most useful language for our approach.
As our research is of a practical nature, we also consider gray literature such as specifications of schemas or websites.
\subsection{Schema Languages}\label{subsec:schemalanguages}

\textit{Schema languages} are formal languages that specify the structure, constraints, and relationships of data, for example in a database or structured data formats.

As this work is concerned with generating a GUI based on a schema, we need to choose a suitable schema language.
The following sections describe existing schema languages.
We will compare them in section~\ref{sec:evaluation-of-schema-languages} to determine which is the most suitable one for this work.
